<h1>Project: Recipes</h1>

<p>This is the HTML course in the Odin Project(URL:https://www.theodinproject.com/).</p>
<p>The Odin Project is the free course for learning to become a fullstack web developer.</p>
<p>And in this lesson(URL:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes),<br>I have to show some skills of HTML.(like how to use h1 tags, p tags, img tags, etc...)</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I did the project once. And this is my second time to try the project.</p>

<h1>Reason: Why do I have to challenge it again?</h1>

<p>I have been learn HTML/CSS/Javascript/Libraries like React, Express for two years.<br>
Almost everyday, I tried to learn something new.</p>

<p>But, as a result, I got some fundamental knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript only.<br> (And a little bit known about React, Node.js, Express etc)</p>

<p>I can not create anything by myself except really simple web site.</p>
<p>I wanted to create beautiful and attractive sites like featured on some Youtube channels <br> 
like this(URL:https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery ) or like this(URL:https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer)

<br>
<p>Of course, I can create these sites if I watch videos.</p>
<p>But, it was useless for me. <br> Because after watching these videos, I can not remember anything and I can not recreate similar sites.</p>

<h1>Probably...</h1>
<p><strong>I pursued new technologies too much more than my abilities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And finally, I noticed. I have to create my own project for becoming a real programmer.</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Someone thought "Oh, you are very silly and what a time useless! You should do it from the beginning!"</p>
<p>...Yes. I admit it.</p>
<p>I took very silly mistakes for a long time. But time never goes back.</p>

<p>So, I decide to <strong> go back basis.</strong></p>

<p>I decide to go back The Odin Project and stick the site in this time.</p>
<p>I decide to read all articles and solve all assignments more seriously.</p>
<p>I decide to not escape other sites or youtube channels even if I meet ambiguous concepts.</p>

<p>When I meet ambiguous concepts, I should read articles several times or take break and read article(s) again until I get concepts clearly.<br>Only after understanding concepts, I should proceed next lesson. (I should not remain ambiguous concepts)</p>

<p>I think this is the best way to learn programming that I learned from my silly and not should be proud of coding journey.<br>
(Of course, I think this method works even if I finish The Odin Project)</p>

<p>Perhaps, my project will become more simple and not to have attractive CSS styles more than past projects<br>(For example, my site will lack cool animations, or transitions effects)<p>

<p>But I have never care.</p>

<p>In this time, the most important thing is for me to create project by myself.</p>
<p>And I want to get real programming skills and mindsets for programmers.</p>

<p>I think it is a difficult way that compare with just take a tutorials and just watch youtube videos.</p>
<p>But I want to become a programmer seriously, so I decide to hard work more than ever.</p>
<p>I have never escape again!!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. And happy coding!!</p>
